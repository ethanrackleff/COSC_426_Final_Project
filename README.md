# COSC 426 Final Project:
This repository contains our:
- **sample data**
- **config files** for models to execute steps
- **bash scripts** for submitting jobs to turing

This README contains instructions for running our experiment on sample data. For the purpose of our proposal, these steps are all run on the same data set. In our final project, we will have separate datasets for our training, validation, and evaluation. We also provide config files and bash scripts to run our experiment with a single model, however we will be performing this using more than one in our final product.

## Step 1: Train models using the train and validation data set


## Step 2: Use TextClassification models on the evaluation data set

## Step 3: Analyze output from model evaluation

for the datasets, run train on both data sets for both models using attached config files
- use bash scripts to submit these jobs to turing
